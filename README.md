This lab introduces you to Amazon Elastic Mapreduce ([Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/)) using the AWS Management Console. Also let you know how to engage S3 with EMR to process the apache log.


## Prerequisites
>The workshop’s region will be in ‘N.Virginia’

>Download both **access-log-20140105** and **do-reports2-edit.pig** two files.

## Lab tutorial
### Upload files to S3
1.1. 	In the **AWS Management Console**, on the **service** menu, click **S3**.

1.2. 	Click **Create bucket** button.

1.3. 	For bucket name, type **ecv-training-your-name**.

1.4.    Click **Create**.

1.5.    Click the bucket which you created, then click **Create folder** button, for folder name type **apache-log-analysis**, click **Save**.

* For Input S3 location, type the location of the input data. For example:ecv-training-annie/apache-log-analysis/.
* For Output S3 location, type the location of the ouput folder. For example:ecv-training-annie/apache-log-analysis/output/.
* For Arguments, leave the field blank. 
* For Action on failure, select **Terminate cluster**.
